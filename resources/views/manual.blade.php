                    <p class="mb-6">
                        Story-Gym.com is a platform designed to enhance storytelling skills through structured exercises and personalized feedback. Upon registering, users agree to an Accountability Contract to stay motivated throughout their journey.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Getting Started</h2>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Accountability Contract:</h3>
                    <p class="mb-6">
                        After registration, users are directed to the Accountability Contract page, which they must agree to before proceeding. The contract encourages daily commitment to the exercises and outlines the benefits of consistent practice.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Assessment Section:</h3>
                    <p class="mb-6">
                        After agreeing to the contract, users are taken to a brief manual (5-minute read) and the Assessment Section. This initial assessment measures skills in three areas: Descriptive Writing, Dialogue, and Character Development. The user selects an exercise type from a dropdown menu, generates a question, and has 30 minutes to complete it. While answering, if typing pauses for more than 3 seconds, a Deletion Counter starts. If it reaches zero, the answer is erased, encouraging focus and avoiding procrastination.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Submitting Answers:</h3>
                    <p class="mb-6">
                        Once the user completes an answer, they press the Submit button, which stores their response in the database along with the question type and submission date.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Grading and Learning Path</h2>
                    <p class="mb-6">
                        After submitting all three exercises, the platform automatically grades them and determines the userâ€™s current level. Based on the grades, the user is directed to a storytelling course on an external Learning Management System (LMS) for further improvement.
                    </p>
